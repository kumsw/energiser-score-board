# Energiser Score Tracker
**School of Code Bootcamp - Week 4 Hackathon**

##### October 2020

This hackathon was my first experience building a full stack application using Express and a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. This score tracker will help coahes and bootcampers keep track of bootcamper scores. The leaderboard can be sorted in order of Gartic Score.

## To Start:

You need to start the server to connect to the database. Use the following command:
`npm run start`

## Hackathon Requirements

- Must use a Database for persistent storage
- Must use the model pattern to allow easy interaction with the data
- Must use an REST API server to manage requests and serve back data
- Must have a front end which allows users to at least view the data

## Main learnings:

- Using PostgreSQL and creating a database on Heroku
- Took time to break down the problem and plan our approach before coding
- Connected up our backend and frontend
- creating a building an Express app
- Sorting our data based on one parameter
- Better understanding of REST API's in a full stack application

## Stretch goals:

- Ability to sort the data on multiple scores.
- Write more models and routes (`DELETE`, `UPDATE`)
